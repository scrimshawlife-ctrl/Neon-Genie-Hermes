# Neon Genie Roadmap

Sibling skill to Kubrick: **shared architecture patterns**, separate domain (opportunity / product intelligence, not cinematic engineering).

## Wave 1 — Ops shell

Installable skill root, Hermes runtime contract, `install.sh`, VERSION/CHANGELOG/QUICKSTART, smoke validator, examples + evals skeleton, flatten nested package.

**Status:** shipped as **v3.2.0**.

## Wave 2 — Domain depth

- Thicken profile contracts
- Fill missing packet schemas (`EvidenceIntelligencePacket`, `MemeticPressurePacket`, `AuditDeliveryPacket`)
- Richer golden/eval cases and anti-overclaim references

**Status:** shipped as **v3.3.0**.

## Wave 3 — Thin operator surface

Optional packaging CLI only (no product brain in Python):

```text
python scripts/neon_genie.py do check | validate | route | receipt
```

**Status:** shipped as **v3.4.0**.

## Wave 4 — Release maturity

CI evals workflow, release checklist, version audit, fixture invariants.

**Status:** shipped as **v3.5.0**.

## Wave 5 — Executable evals + recipes

- Deterministic golden gate runner (`do eval`) comparing case `expected` to gate logic
- Product-audit packaging recipe (`do recipe`) for first operator path
- CI artifacts from recipe output

**Status:** shipped as **v3.6.0**.

## Wave 6 — Recipe family + deeper validation

- Multi-recipe dispatcher (product-audit, zero-option variants, fragmentation)
- Typed packet validation subset + strict authority checks
- Expanded golden gates (fictional resource, scorecard override ban)
- Sample packets for offline validation demos

**Status:** shipped as **v3.7.0**.

## Premiere program (post packaging waves)

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-neon-genie-premiere-program-design.md`.

| Wave | Status |
|------|--------|
| P0 Evidence spine | shipped **3.8.0** |
| P1 Prose excellence | shipped **3.9.0** (golden transcripts + `do transcripts`) |
| P2 Outcome density | shipped **3.10.0** (completion_proof, learn ledger, post-SEAL) |
| P3 Category ownership | shipped **3.11.0** (`docs/PREMIERE.md`, `docs/DEMO.md`, gallery) |

## Premiere program complete (P0–P3)

Public entry points:

- [PREMIERE.md](./PREMIERE.md) — thesis & comparison  
- [DEMO.md](./DEMO.md) — 10-minute path  
- [examples/gallery/](../examples/gallery/) — sanitized exemplars  

## Maintenance / corpus depth

| Release | Focus |
|---------|--------|
| **3.12.0** | Commercial + audit recipes; `do doctor` full-suite smoke |
| **3.13.0** | Agentic/memetic recipes; transcripts 06–07 (x402 / Gate D) |
| **3.14.0** | Evidence + opportunity recipes; transcripts 08–09 (10 recipes, 9 goldens) |
| **3.15.0** | README How to use; simplified `do <job>` help for agents & users |
| **3.16.0** | Hermes Skills Hub tap package (`skills/neon-genie/`) + distribution docs |

Further work: live Hermes hardening, operator feedback, optional official catalog PR — not a new premiere wave.

## Non-goals (all waves)

- Merging Neon Genie and Kubrick domains
- Auto-execution, spending, or canon promotion
- Shared monorepo runtime library (revisit only after Wave 2 if a third skill needs a scaffold)
